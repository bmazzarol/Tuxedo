# Getting Started

To use this library, simply include `Tuxedo.dll` in your project or
grab
it from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tuxedo/), and add
this to the top of each `.cs` file that needs it:

```C#
using Tuxedo;
```

If you're using
[implicit usings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview#implicit-using-directives)
the above is not necessary. This will also import
many useful aliases, and it is recommended to use them over the full
names.
